# **Portable Dishwasher Project**

<br>
<br>

**Project Overview**

Our team developed a small-scale dishwasher that performs a full wash, rinse, and spin cycle. The system is triggered by a PIR motion sensor and uses a DC motor to rotate the drum, along with a pump and relay module to manage water flow. The entire cycle is controlled through Arduino firmware using timing logic and state management.

**My Contributions**

- Developed and debugged the Arduino firmware for cycle control

- Implemented wash, rinse, and spin timing logic

- Integrated the PIR sensor using interrupt-based triggering

- Tested, refined, and validated the system to ensure consistent performance
